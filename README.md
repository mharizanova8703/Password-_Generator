# Password _Generator
 I create a  safe  password generator  that creates a randomized custom password for users.With this in mind, there are millions of possibilities of passwords that will be generated from one password generator before it begins to repeat itself.I use special characters(slashes, asterisks, and braces) upper and lower case letters and numbers to secure the password.The length of the password is between  8 and no more than 128 characters .
