# Password _Generator


 I create a  safe  password generator  that creates a randomized custom password for users.With this in mind, there are millions of possibilities of passwords that will be generated from one password generator before it begins to repeat itself.I use special characters(slashes, asterisks, and braces) upper and lower case letters and numbers to secure the password.The length of the password is between  8 and no more than 128 characters .
 Building the Generator I use a HTML, CSS and powerful  JavaScript.
 
 To prevent your passwords from being hacked by social engineering, brute force or dictionary attack method, and keep your online accounts safe, you should notice that:
 1. Do not use the same password, security question and answer for multiple important accounts.
 2. Use a password that has at least 16 characters, use at least one number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one special symbol.
 3. Do not use the names of your families, friends or pets in your passwords.
 4. Do not use postcodes, house numbers, phone numbers, birthdates, ID card numbers, social security numbers, and so on in your passwords.
 5. Do not use any dictionary word in your passwords. Examples of strong passwords: ePYHc~dS*)8$+V-' , qzRtC{6rXN3N\RgL , zbfUMZPE6`FC%)sZ. Examples of weak passwords: qwert12345, Gbt3fC79ZmMEFUFJ, 1234567890, 987654321, nortonpassword.
